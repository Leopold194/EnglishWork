					<h2>Hey visitor of this website!</h2>
					<h3>Are you a music lover? Do you want to improve your musical culture?</h3>
					<h3>It's the place to be!</h3>
					<p>Welcome in New Orleans, the kingdom of the Jazz! You don't believe me, okay, so let's me to introduce you the New Orleans's atmosphere. Do you know the movie "A tuba to Cuba"? I think not. If you're curious, watch him and you will understand many things. What? New Orleans is one of the most important place in the World of the Jazz! I'm sure that you know one legend who came to this amazing city. If I say : "What a wonderful world". Yes! Louis Armstrong was born in New Orleans, when he was young, he sang in the corner of the street. To never forget this legend, the city gave his name at one park of New Orleans, you can visit it, it's really wonderful, like in the music, and there is a bronze statue of Louis Armstrong, no joke!</p>
					<p>Finally, I can talk about Mardi Gras, this fabulous party, with a lot of music, not only jazz and naturally not only music, but the costumes, the dances,... So if you want to learn Jazz's history, or just appreciate a really nice trip with a lot of good music, come on, we are waiting you !</p>
					<h2>See you later in the wonderful World!</h2>
